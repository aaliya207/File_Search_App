# 🔍 File Search App

A light and playful Python GUI tool that helps you search your files quickly by keyword. It’s not super fancy, but it gets the job done in a cute way. 🌸

## 🌟 Features
- Indexes all files in a selected folder.
- Lets you search by filename or file content.
- Pastel-colored, kawaii-styled UI with emojis and Comic Sans ✨
- Warns you gently if you forget to pick a folder.
- Displays a little "please wait..." message when searching big folders.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Run the script using Python 3.
2. Click the **📁 Browse** button to choose a folder.
3. Wait for the cute popup saying indexing is done!
4. Type your keyword in the box and click **💫 Search**.
5. Boom! Relevant file paths show up in the list.

## ⚠️ Notes
- It reads all files as text. Binary or unreadable files are skipped silently.
- Might be a bit slow for huge folders (working on it 💪).

## 💖 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No extra libraries needed — it runs on pure Tkinter and standard Python.
